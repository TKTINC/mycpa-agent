# MyCPA - Conversational AI Accountant
## Updated Requirements and Architecture Specification

### Executive Summary

MyCPA is a conversational AI accountant designed to serve as users' complete financial brain through natural chat and voice interaction. Unlike traditional financial apps that require users to actively check and manage their finances, MyCPA proactively monitors, analyzes, and communicates financial insights, acting as a knowledgeable accountant who knows your complete financial picture and tells you what you need to know, when you need to know it.

The core philosophy centers on proactive financial intelligence rather than reactive financial management. MyCPA continuously monitors all connected accounts, analyzes patterns and trends, and surfaces relevant insights and recommendations through natural conversation. Users interact with MyCPA as they would with a trusted personal accountant who has comprehensive knowledge of their financial situation and provides timely, actionable guidance.

This updated specification aligns with the refined vision of MyCPA as a focused conversational AI accountant with ten core capabilities that deliver immediate, practical value through sophisticated financial monitoring, analysis, and proactive communication.

### Core Philosophy: Proactive Financial Intelligence

MyCPA operates on the fundamental principle that financial management should be proactive rather than reactive. Traditional financial applications require users to actively check balances, review transactions, and identify optimization opportunities. MyCPA reverses this paradigm by continuously monitoring financial activity and proactively surfacing insights, alerts, and recommendations when they are most relevant and actionable.

The proactive approach means that MyCPA initiates conversations when important financial events occur, opportunities arise, or user attention is needed. Rather than waiting for users to ask questions, MyCPA actively communicates relevant information such as unusual spending patterns, upcoming bill due dates, tax optimization opportunities, or cash flow concerns. This approach transforms financial management from a periodic task into an ongoing conversation with an intelligent financial advisor.

The conversational interface serves as the primary interaction method, enabling natural language communication through both text chat and voice interaction. Users can ask complex financial questions, request specific analysis, or simply receive proactive updates about their financial situation. The conversation maintains context across interactions, remembering user preferences, financial goals, and previous discussions to provide personalized and relevant communication.

The complete financial awareness capability ensures that MyCPA has comprehensive understanding of users' financial situations across all connected accounts. This holistic view enables sophisticated analysis and insights that consider the complete financial picture rather than isolated account information. MyCPA understands the relationships between different accounts, the impact of transactions across the entire financial ecosystem, and the implications of financial decisions on overall financial health.
