# MyCPA - Conversational AI Accountant

## Your Complete Financial Brain Through Natural Conversation

MyCPA is a conversational AI accountant designed to serve as your complete financial brain through natural chat and voice interaction. Unlike traditional financial apps that require you to actively check and manage your finances, MyCPA proactively monitors, analyzes, and communicates financial insights, acting as a knowledgeable accountant who knows your complete financial picture and tells you what you need to know, when you need to know it.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy: Proactive Financial Intelligence

MyCPA operates on the principle that financial management should be **proactive rather than reactive**. Instead of waiting for you to ask questions, MyCPA actively communicates relevant information such as:

- "Your emergency fund is low"
- "You're spending 40% more on restaurants this month"
- "That equipment purchase will save you $1,200 in taxes"
- "Your business cash flow will be tight in March - consider delaying that equipment purchase"
- "Hey, I noticed a $500 charge at Best Buy in Texas - was that you?"
